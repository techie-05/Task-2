# üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Report

## üìù Project Overview

This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset to gain insights, understand distributions, identify patterns, and detect any anomalies. The analysis focuses on understanding the behavior of numeric features using statistical summaries and visual techniques.

## üìÇ Steps Performed

### 1. **Summary Statistics**
Generated key descriptive statistics to understand the central tendency and spread of each numeric variable, including:
- **Mean**
- **Median**
- **Standard Deviation**
- **Minimum and Maximum**

These statistics provide a quick overview of the data distribution and potential outliers.

---

### 2. **Data Visualization: Histograms & Boxplots**
- **Histograms** were created to visualize the frequency distribution of numerical features.

These plots helped in identifying:
- Skewed distributions
- Potential outliers
- Range and spread of each variable

---

### 3. **Feature Relationships: Pairplot & Correlation Matrix**
- **Pairplots (scatterplot matrix)** were used to visualize relationships and interactions between features.
- **Correlation Matrix (Heatmap)** was created to identify the strength and direction of linear relationships between numerical features.

This step helped in uncovering:
- Strongly correlated features
- Redundant variables
- Possible predictors for modeling

---

### 4. **Patterns, Trends, and Anomalies**
From the visuals and statistics:
- Patterns and groupings within the data were noted.
- Outliers and anomalies were detected using boxplots and z-scores.
- Trends across multiple variables were inferred using scatterplot grids.

---

### 5. **Basic Inferences**
Based on the visual analysis:
- Features with high variability were flagged for potential normalization.
- Correlated features were shortlisted for feature engineering or dimensionality reduction.
- Skewed variables identified for potential transformation.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

The EDA process provided crucial insights into the structure and quality of the dataset. These insights will support further preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building steps.
